## Background and Context
This game is about war, and the only way to win is by claiming stars and planets for your empire. In order to do so, you deploy your armada in the galaxy - destroy enemy ships, expand your empire, and claim the spoils of war for yourself.


##Objectives
The game ends when all star(s) have been claimed, at which time players will count the number of planets they have conquered - each conquered planet is worth 1 point, and some combinations may yield bonuses (see scoring section of this rule booklet)


## Setup
1. Pick a map (see appendix section of this booklet - advanced players may choose to create their own map).
- Place the planets on the playing field in accordance with the selected map configuration (from now on we will refer to this setting as, the "galaxy"). Any unused planet can be removed from the game.
- Shuffle the spaceship cards (supply stations do not count as spaceships!) and place them face down next to the galaxy. 
- Players determine the order in which they will play. The player who most recently went in space starts... otherwise we assume you are smart enough to figure out a way to select who goes first... if not the player on your left is the first player.
- The first and second player draw one and two spaceship cards respectively. All other players draw 3 spaceship cards.

## The Mechanics
Planets, spaceships and supply stations have a set number of resistance points attributed to them (that is, how much damage they can sustain before being conquered). The number of resistance points is clearly identified in the #$^#% symbol on each card. 

Spaceships deal damage in one or more directions. The strength and direction of the damage dealt is displayed on the cards in the #%^$%&^ symbols.

Most planets are equipped with forcefields to protect them from invaders. Forcefields block all damage dealt in their direction, and can be identified on the border of planet cards with the following symbol %^$%^ 

A planet or spaceship is claimed when it receives damage greater or equal to its resistance points. 

Throughout the game, players will accumulate cards. They can either be;

1. Spaceships and supply stations drawn from their respective draw piles, placed in the player's hand,
- Claimed planets and stars, placed next to the player in the scoring pile,
- Claimed spaceships, placed next to the player in the salvage yard.

For those of you who do better with visual support - you may refer to the illustrative examples in the right margin of this page.


## Turns
A player's turn is played in 6 steps. Once a turn is completed, the player to his left begins his.

1. Deployment
2. Special powers
3. Damage
4. Conquer
5. Play Again
6. Draw and Discard

### 1. Deployment

During this step, the player must deploy a spaceship or supply station from his hand into the galaxy. Spaceships and supply stations may only be played next to another card. Additionally, they may not be placed in a position where they would sustain damage greater or equal to their resistance points.

### 2. Special Powers

Some spaceships have special powers, and they activate immediately after being deployed.

- %$^#$ : You may discard a spaceship or supply station from your hand.
- $%^$%^: You may draw a spaceship from the spaceship draw pile into your hand.
- %^%$^$: Rotate a planet into desired position.
- $%^$% : Rotate a spaceship or supply station into desired position.


### 3. Damage

All spaceships and supply stations deal their damage simultaneously. 

The player may choose to remove spaceships from his salvage yard - for every two spaceships removed, he may deal 1 additional damage to a target of his choice. Spaceships removed in this way are placed into the spaceship discard pile. 


### 4. Conquer

Planets and stars are claimed when;

- They sustain damage greater or equal to their resistance points.

Spaceships and supply stations are claimed when;

- They sustain damage greater or equal to their resistance points,
- They are part of a group of spaceships and supply stations that are not connected to any planet or star.

When they are claimed;

* Planets are placed in the player's scoring pile,
* Spaceships are placed in the player's salvage yard,
* Supply stations are destroyed - they are placed back into the supply station pile.

### 5. Play Again

A player may choose to play steps 1 through 4 ("action phase") up to three times in his turn - assuming he has enough spaceship cards in his hand. 

### 6. Draw and Discard

For every action phase completed past the first, the player draws a supply station.

The player may choose to remove spaceships from his salvage yard - for every three spaceships removed, he may discard a supply station from his hand. Supply stations discarded in this way are placed back into the supply station draw pile. 

At the end of his turn, if the player has no cards remaining in his hand, he draws 3 cards from the spaceship draw pile. If there are no more cards, shuffle the spaceship discard pile and use it as the new draw pile. 

The player removes all spaceships from his salvage yard in excess of 2. Spaceships removed in this way are placed into the spaceship discard pile. 


## Game Variants

### Face-off (players 2, 4 or 6)

1. Players are split in 2 teams, each with the same number of players in each. Each team will be assigned a colour (blue and orange)
- Randomly build the galaxy using all the planets and stars available. For a shorter game, you may use less but make sure that each colour uses the exact same planets and stars
- Players are placed around the table so that no two player from the same team will play one just after the other
- A player may never claim a planet or star of the opposing team's colour. Planets or stars that would normally be claimed in this way remain in the galaxy until such time as they are claimed by a player of their own colour.
